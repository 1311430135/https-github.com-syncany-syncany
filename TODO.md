Syncany To-Do List
=====================
If you'd like to help developing Syncany, there are a few ways to do so.

1. **TODO markers in the Java code**: 
The code contains lots of *TODO* markers, classified in *high*, *medium* and *low*. Using
the *Tasks* tab in Eclipse, pick one or two and start coding. To get started, check out
the [README](README.md) file. 

2. **Major To-Dos**: 
Besides the TODO markers, there are lots of major things that need doing. There is an always 
up-to-date list in the issue tracker with the tag [looking-for-help](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/issues?labels=looking-for-help). 
We'll eventually get around to implementing all that, but for now we want to concentrate on making a stable
core. If you have questions, feel free to ask.
